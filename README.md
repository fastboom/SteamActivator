# SteamActivator
Automated steam key activation created/tested only on Windows 7.

NOTE: Currently hardcoded to use the file C:\jan18keys.txt. So create that file, I'll change this later... Just lazy :) 
# Download
Checkout the release tab!

# How to use:
You must have steam open, once it's open, you load your list of keys and press the On button! Sit back and wait!
